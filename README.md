#### 2. More Serious Project

**Project Name: Decentralized Marketplace for Digital Goods**

**Objective**: Develop a decentralized marketplace where users can buy and sell digital goods (like eBooks, art, and software) using Toncoin. Integrate with Telegram for user authentication and transaction notifications.

**Features**:

1. **User Authentication via Telegram**:

   - Use Telegram's authentication features to sign in users.

2. **Listing and Browsing Digital Goods**:

   - Create a platform where users can list digital goods for sale.
   - Implement search and filter functionalities to browse available items.

3. **Smart Contract for Transactions**:

   - Develop a smart contract on the TON blockchain to handle transactions.
   - Ensure the contract securely transfers Toncoin from buyer to seller and releases the digital goods.

4. **Notification System**:

   - Integrate with Telegram to send notifications for transaction updates, new listings, and messages between buyers and sellers.

5. **Reputation System**:
   - Implement a reputation system based on user feedback and transaction history to build trust within the marketplace.

**Development Steps**:

1. **Backend Development**:

   - Set up a server to handle user data, listings, and transactions.
   - Connect to the TON blockchain to interact with smart contracts.

2. **Smart Contract Development**:

   - Write and deploy smart contracts for listing items and handling payments.

3. **Frontend Development**:

   - Create a user-friendly web interface for browsing and listing digital goods.
   - Integrate with Telegram for authentication and notifications.

4. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Thoroughly test all components of the marketplace.
   - Deploy the application and monitor for any issues.

**Example Architecture**:

- **Backend**: Node.js/Express.js for handling API requests.
- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface.
- **Blockchain**: Smart contracts written in Solidity for TON.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user and listing data.
- **Authentication**: Telegram OAuth for user sign-in.
- **Notifications**: Telegram Bot API for sending notifications.

  [Leo: On this link on the main page they say they need apps "that can attract new users like Notcoin, Catizen and Pixels" which are kind of stupid and viral but in the "Ideas" tab there are more "mature" ideas. On the same link there are many videos, ressources, tools.]

### The Open League Hackathon

Below are the objectives of The Open League Hackathon:

- Find more dapps with creative, simple, and viral token mining mechanisms that can attract new users like Notcoin, Catizen and Pixels
- Find dapps with that appeal to a mass audience, TON is a blockchain for everyone. Where complexity dies and simplicity thrives. Weâ€™re looking for teams building mini-apps that integrate web3 features seamlessly and appeal to everyone.
- Recruit proven dapps from other blockchains who want to leverage TON, Telegram, and The Open League to attract millions of users.
- Recruit proven mini-apps developers and teams from other SuperApps that want to integrate web3 features and leverage TON, Telegram, and The Open League to attract millions of users.
