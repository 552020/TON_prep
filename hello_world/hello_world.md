### Team Roles for the "Hello World" TON Wallet Integration Mini-App

#### Step 1: Prepare the Development Environment

**Backend Developer**

**Responsibilities**:

- Set up the TON blockchain environment.
- Install necessary SDKs and tools for interacting with the TON blockchain.
- Create and manage the TON Wallet, ensuring it can be accessed programmatically.
- Develop the backend logic for fetching wallet balances and transaction history from the TON blockchain.

**Tasks**:

1. **Install SDKs**: Install the TON SDK and any other required libraries.
2. **Set Up Wallet**: Create a TON Wallet and obtain test tokens for development.
3. **API Development**: Develop API endpoints for fetching wallet balance and transaction history.
4. **Integration with TON Blockchain**: Write the code to interact with the TON blockchain and retrieve wallet data.

**Sample Task Breakdown**:

```bash
# Install necessary packages
npm install ton-sdk express
```

**Example Code for Fetching Balance**:

```javascript
const { TonClient } = require("ton-client-node-js");

async function getWalletBalance(address) {
  const client = new TonClient({ network: { server_address: "net.ton.dev" } });
  const balance = await client.net.query_collection({
    collection: "accounts",
    filter: { id: { eq: address } },
    result: "balance",
  });
  return balance;
}
```

**Frontend Developer**

**Responsibilities**:

- Set up the Telegram Bot and handle user interactions.
- Develop the frontend logic for displaying wallet balances and transaction history.
- Create and manage the Telegram Bot commands and responses.
- Ensure smooth communication between the Telegram Bot and the backend API.

**Tasks**:

1. **Create Telegram Bot**: Use the Telegram Bot API to create a new bot.
2. **Handle Bot Commands**: Implement basic commands like `/start` and `/balance`.
3. **Frontend Development**: Develop the frontend logic to fetch data from the backend API and display it to the user.
4. **Integration with Backend**: Ensure the frontend can communicate with the backend API to fetch and display the necessary data.

**Sample Task Breakdown**:

```bash
# Install necessary packages
npm install node-telegram-bot-api axios
```

**Example Code for Telegram Bot**:

```javascript
const TelegramBot = require("node-telegram-bot-api");
const axios = require("axios");

const bot = new TelegramBot("YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN", { polling: true });

bot.onText(/\/start/, (msg) => {
  bot.sendMessage(msg.chat.id, "Welcome to TON Wallet Bot! Use /balance to check your balance.");
});

bot.onText(/\/balance/, async (msg) => {
  const userId = msg.chat.id;
  const response = await axios.get(`http://localhost:3000/wallet/${userId}/balance`);
  const balance = response.data.balance || "Error fetching balance";
  bot.sendMessage(msg.chat.id, `Your balance is: ${balance} TON`);
});
```

### Collaboration Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**:

   - Both team members set up a shared GitHub repository for version control.
   - Agree on API endpoints and data formats for communication between frontend and backend.

2. **Development**:

   - **Backend Developer** works on setting up the TON environment, creating the wallet, and developing API endpoints.
   - **Frontend Developer** sets up the Telegram bot, handles bot commands, and develops the user interface.

3. **Integration**:

   - Regularly sync code changes via GitHub.
   - Schedule integration sessions to test communication between the Telegram bot and the backend.

4. **Testing and Deployment**:
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure all features work as expected.
   - Deploy the application and perform end-to-end testing.

By clearly dividing tasks and maintaining regular communication, both team members can efficiently contribute to the project and ensure a successful outcome.
